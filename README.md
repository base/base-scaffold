Base plugin that adds support for generating files from a declarative scaffold configuration.

```

## Usage

Can be used with any [base](https://github.com/node-base/base) application. See example [base applications](#base-apps).

```

## API

### [.isScaffold](index.js#L50)

Returns true if the given value is a valid `Scaffold`.

**Params**

* `returns` **{Boolean}**

**Example**

app.isScaffold('foo');
//=> false

var Scaffold = require('scaffold');
var scaffold = new Scaffold();
app.isScaffold(scaffold);
//=> true
```

### [.scaffold](index.js#L77)

Get scaffold `name` from `app.scaffolds`, or set scaffold `name` with the given `config`.

**Params**

* `name` **{String|Object|Function}**
* `config` **{Object|Fucntion}**
* `returns` **{Object}**: Returns the app instance when setting a scaffold, or the scaffold instance when getting a scaffold.

**Example**

```js
app.scaffold('foo', {
  docs: {
    options: {},
    files: {
      src: ['*'],
      dest: 'foo'
    }
  }
});

// or
var scaffold = app.scaffold('foo');
```

**Params**

* `name` **{String}**
* `config` **{Object|Function}**

**Example**

```js
app.addScaffold('foo', {
  docs: {
    options: {},
    files: {
      src: ['*'],
      dest: 'foo'
    }
  }
});
```

**Params**

* `name` **{String}**
* `options` **{Object}**

**Example**

```js
var scaffold = app.getScaffold('foo');

// or create an instance of `Scaffold` using the given object
var scaffold = app.getScaffold({
  docs: {
    options: {},
    files: {
      src: ['*'],
      dest: 'foo'
    }
  }
});
```

### [Scaffold](index.js#L226)

Get or set the `Scaffold` constructor. Exposed as a getter/setter to allow it to be customized before or after instantiation.

// set
app.Scaffold = CustomScaffoldFn;

var scaffold = new app.Scaffold();
```
